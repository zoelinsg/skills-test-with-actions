## Step 3: Trigger the workflows

As specified in our workflows, they will only run when a pull request is targeting the `main` branch.

Pull requests have a nice advantage when a workflow is associated with them. The run status and results can be displayed directly in the conversation feed.

### ⌨️ Activity: Start a PR and propose a code change

1. Return to the VS Code Codespace.

1. Create a new branch based from `main` with the following name and **publish** it to GitHub.

   ```txt
   reenable-unit-test
   ```

1. Double check that you are on the `reenable-unit-test` branch, then open the `tests/calculations_test.py` file.

1. After investigating the code, we see a commented out test on line 56. Uncomment it to re-enable it.

   > Hopefully it wasn't disable to get around testing! 😱

   ```py
   def test_get_nth_fibonacci_ten():
    """Test with n=10."""
    # Arrange
    n = 10

    # Act
    result = get_nth_fibonacci(n)

    # Assert
    assert result == 89
   ```

1. Commit the changes and push them to GitHub.

1. Return to the browser and create a pull request. Use the following details.

   - **base:** `main`
   - **source:** `reenable-unit-test`
   - **title**: `Reenable unit test that was disabled`

   Did you accidentally commit to the `main` branch? Here is a command to undo the last commit and force update the repository on GitHub. Be careful not to go back too many steps though! You don't want to remove your new workflows!

   ```bash
   git reset --hard HEAD~1
   git push -f
   ```

1. After the pull request is created, look near the Merge button to see many workflows running.

   - Our coverage workflow will fail, letting us know we have a test to fix.

1. With the pull request started, Mona should be busy checking your work and preparing the next steps.

- If the checks don't appear updated, try refreshing the page. It's possible the workflow ran and the page just hasn't been updated with the change.
