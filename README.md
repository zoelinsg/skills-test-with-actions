# Test with Actions

_Protect your code with automated unit tests and coverage reports._

## Welcome

- **Who is this for**: Developers, DevOps Engineers, new GitHub users, Testing Engineers
- **What you'll learn**: What continuous integration is, how to create a workflow with GitHub Actions for testing, and how to enforce it.
- **What you'll build**: We'll enforce test coverage on sample Python code to run tests against several versions of python in parallel and report results to a pull request, protecting our production version.
- **Prerequisites**:
  - [Hello GitHub Actions](https://github.com/skills/hello-github-actions)
- **How long**: This course takes less than 60 minutes to complete.

In this course, you will:

1. Open and run tests in an existing sample project
2. Add a testing workflow through the GitHub web interface
3. Add a coverage workflow in the code editor
4. Investigate and fix a failed test
5. Enforce tests to pass before merging code changes

When copying the exercise, we recommend the following settings:

- For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
- We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).

If the exercise isn't ready in 20 seconds:

1. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds, then refresh the page.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the issue created in your repository.
3. If the page doesn't refresh automatically, please check the [Actions](../../actions) tab.
   - Check to see if a job is running. Sometimes it simply takes a bit longer.
   - If the page shows a failed job, please submit an issue. Nice, you found a bug! üêõ
